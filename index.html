                                I'd like to preface this by saying that my family 
                                and I usually don't go on long trips, especially 
                                not for treats, but this was definitely worth the 
                                trip. It was like nothing that I've ever tasted 
                                before. How should I put this without being too 
                                vulgar? Well, the ice cream tasted like it came
                                straight from a cow, an ice cream cow. And I was
                                a calf slurping up the delicious ice cream
                                from the teet. My first lick put me in a trance-like 
                                state, I must admit I was seeing a therapist before 
                                coming here, but the entire experience has healed  
                                me. I'm not the only one who would describe this 
                                experience like this, but my whole family did as 
                                well. We asked the owner whether he had drugged 
                                our ice cream, and he chuckled and told us, 
                                "No such thing was in there." he added, "That 
                                tasting such fresh ingredients for the first time 
                                can induce a trance-like state in some people." 
                                I definitely will be coming back, my family included!

                                Every few months or so, coming back from work, I usually 
                                see stores with signs saying "grand opening," Boy,
                                could I care less. Just like clockwork, in they 
                                come, and out they go. I've created a game of sorts
                                trying to predict how long it will take for these stores 
                                to close. And unfortunately, I've been stumped by this one,
                                having changed my answer TEN TIMES. I mean, I'm no clairvoyant,
                                but I have a keen eye for predicting the closures 
                                of these stores. But this one has been a nightmare,
                                maybe I lost my spark, but then another store opened 
                                up, and I correctly predicted its closure, so my spark 
                                was still there. I mean, consider this, a store opens 
                                in winter which is really not that interesting, is it?
                                But now consider that this is an ICE CREAM SHOP!!!! 
                                Every single day I see new people coming in and out. 
                                What kind of demented mind enjoys freezing to death? 
                                So, I theorized that this must be a money laundering 
                                business; surely their ice cream can't be that good. 
                                So, one day I decided to enter the shop, and boy, what 
                                a bore nothing special about it at all. But I must say 
                                that ice cream is pretty darn good. I usually hate being 
                                cold, but I didn’t mind it just this one time, take that 
                                as you will.
